# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression  This project implements a complete **Machine Learning pipeline** to predict whether a breast tumor is **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)** using **Logistic Regression**.  ---  ## 📌 Project Flow (Step-by-Step)  ### 🔹 Step 1: Import Required Libraries All necessary libraries for: - Data handling (`pandas`, `numpy`) - Data visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`) - Machine learning and evaluation (`scikit-learn`) are imported.  ---  ### 🔹 Step 2: Load the Dataset The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.  **Objective:** - Convert raw data into a structured format.  ---  ### 🔹 Step 3: Data Inspection & Validation Initial checks are performed to ensure data quality: - Missing values check - Duplicate rows check - Data types and statistical summary  ---  ### 🔹 Step 4: Feature and Target Separation The dataset is divided into: - **Features (X):** All independent variables - **Target (y):** The dependent variable (`target` column)  ---  ### 🔹 Step 5: Train–Test Split The data is split into: - **80% Training Data** - **20% Testing Data**  This ensures unbiased model evaluation.  ---  ### 🔹 Step 6: Feature Scaling All features are standardized using **StandardScaler**: - Training data is fitted and transformed - Testing data is transformed using the same scaler  **Purpose:** - Improve model performance and convergence  ---  ### 🔹 Step 7: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Data visualization techniques are applied: - Target class distribution (Pie Chart) - Correlation of features with the target (Bar Plot) - Feature-to-feature correlation (Heatmap)  **Objective:** - Understand data patterns and relationships  ---  ### 🔹 Step 8: Model Selection A **Logistic Regression** model is selected since the problem is a **binary classification task**.  ---  ### 🔹 Step 9: Model Training The model is trained using the scaled training dataset to learn patterns from the data.  ---  ### 🔹 Step 10: Prediction Predictions are made on the test dataset to evaluate model performance.  ---  ### 🔹 Step 11: Model Evaluation The trained model is evaluated using multiple performance metrics: - Accuracy Score - Confusion Matrix - Precision, Recall, F1-score - F2 Score (Recall-focused) - F0.5 Score (Precision-focused) - Log Loss  ---  ### 🔹 Step 12: ROC Curve & AUC Score - Probabilities for the positive class are predicted - ROC Curve is plotted - AUC score is calculated to measure overall classification performance  ---  ## ✅ Final Outcome The project successfully builds and evaluates a Logistic Regression model using a complete machine learning workflow, including preprocessing, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation.  ---  ## 🧠 Key Learnings - End-to-end ML pipeline implementation - Importance of feature scaling - Handling medical classification problems - Model evaluation using multiple metrics - ROC–AUC interpretation  ---  ## 🛠️ Technologies Used - Python - Pandas - NumPy - Matplotlib - Seaborn - Scikit-learn  ---  ## 📊 Model Type - **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression   - **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  ---  ## 📁 Project Structure
